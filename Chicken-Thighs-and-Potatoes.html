            <li>2 pounds bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Mix paprika, garlic, onion powder, Greek seasoning, sazonador total, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon seasoning in a small bowl; cover and set aside until needed for the potatoes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Place remaining seasoning in a 1-gallon resealable bag with water, 4 tablespoons olive oil, and vinegar. Add chicken thighs; massage to coat with seasoning, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 5 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, place 1 tablespoon reserved seasoning in a small bowl with remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil; stir to combine. Toss potatoes in and stir until well coated. Combine potatoes and thighs in the air fryer basket.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Cook in the preheated air fryer until potatoes are tender and chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 28 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
